## Overview

This application uses a Linear Regression model to predict a startup's profit based on its spending in three key areas: R&D, Administration, and Marketing. The model was trained on a dataset of 50 startups and their corresponding profits.

## Features

- **Profit Prediction**: Enter your budget allocation to get instant profit forecasts
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs showing the relationship between spending and profits
- **Model Performance**: Comprehensive metrics and visualizations of the model's accuracy
- **Data Analysis**: State-wise comparison and distribution of profits and expenses
- **Download Results**: Export your prediction results to Excel
